# CalculatorApp_Java
My own calculator using Java 17 and Swing, AWT, Math library. Use some tricks to add buttons not by hand, but by loops, and think on it, as of collection.
Because use title on button to do operation, R (rotate) is +/-, P (power), S (square root).
And GUI is not as standard calculator, but user-friendly
